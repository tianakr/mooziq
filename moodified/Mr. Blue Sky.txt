Sun is shinin' in the sky,
There ain't a cloud in sight
It's stopped rainin'
Everybody's in a play
And don't you know
It's a beautiful new day.



Runnin' down the avenue,(Pant, Pant, Pant)

See how the sun shines brightly

In the city on the streets

Where once was pity,

Mr. Blue Sky is living here today.



[Chorus:]

Mr. Blue Sky, please tell us why,

You had to hide away

For so long where did we go wrong.



Hey there Mr. Blue

We're so pleased to be with you

Look around see what you do,

Everybody smiles at you.



Hey you with the pretty face,

Welcome to the human race

A celebration Mr. Blue Sky's

Up there waitin' and today

Is the day we've waited for



[Chorus]



Mr. Blue you did it right,

But soon comes Mr. Night,

Creepin' over, now his

Hand is on your shoulder,

Never mind I'll remember you this way.



[Chorus]
