  "lyrics": "We live on a mountain\nRight at the top\nThere's a beautiful view\nFrom the top of the mountain\nEvery morning I walk towards the edge...\nAnd throw little things off\nLike car-parts, bottles and cutlery\nOr whatever I find lying around.\n\nIt's become a habit\nA way\nTo start the day\n\nI go through all this\nBefore you wake up\nSo I can feel happier\nTo be safe up here with you\nI go through all this\nBefore you wake up\nSo I can feel happier\nTo be safe up here with you\n\nIt's early morning\nNo-one is awake\nI'm back at my cliff\nStill throwing things off\nI listen to the sounds they make\nOn their way down\nI follow with my eyes 'til they crash\nI imagine what my body would sound like\nSlamming against those rocks\nAnd when it lands\nWill my eyes be closed or open?\n\nI go through all this\nBefore you wake up\nSo I can feel happier\nTo be safe up here with you\n\nI go through all this Before you wake up So I can feel happier To be safe up here with you I go through all this Before you wake up So I can feel happier To be safe up here with you (Safe up here...Safe up here (repeat lots))"
