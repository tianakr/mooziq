(Girl, girl, girl)\nGirl, how do you feel being a girl, girl? (Girl, girl)\nMan, I don't know, I'm just a girl (girl, girl, girl, girl)\nYeah, I don't know if you like me\nSometimes I think you might hate me\nSometimes I think I might hate you\nMaybe you just wanna be me\nYou always say, \"Let's go out\"\nSo we go eat at a restaurant\nSometimes it feels a bit awkward\n'Cause we don't have much in common\nPeople say we're alike\nThey say we've got the same hair\nWe talk about making music\nBut I don't know if it's honest\nCan't tell if you wanna see me\nFalling over and failing\nAnd you can't tell what you're feeling\nI think I know how you feel\nGirl, it's so confusing sometimes to be a girl (girl, girl, girl, girl)\nGirl, it's so confusing sometimes to be a girl (girl, girl, girl, girl)\nGirl, how do you feel being a girl? (Girl, girl, girl, girl)\nGirl, how do you feel being a girl? (Girl, girl)\nMan, I don't know, I'm just a girl (girl, girl, girl, girl)\nYou're all about writing poems\nBut I'm about throwing parties\nThink you should come to my party\nAnd put your hands up\nI think we're totally different\nBut opposites do attract\nMaybe we're so meant to be\nJust you and me\n'Cause people say we're alike\nThey say we've got the same hair\nOne day we might make some music\nThe internet would go crazy\nBut you might still wanna see me\nFalling over and failing\nAt least we're closer to being on the same page\nGirl, it's so confusing sometimes to be a girl (girl, girl, girl, girl)\nGirl, it's so confusing sometimes to be a girl (girl, girl, girl, girl)\nGirl, how do you feel being a girl? (Girl, girl, girl, girl)\nGirl, how do you feel being a girl? (Girl, girl)\nMan, I don't know, I'm just a girl (girl, girl, girl, girl)"
