    "lyrics": "We all came out to montreux\nOn the lake geneva shoreline\nTo make records with a mobile\nWe didn't have much time\nFrank zappa and the mothers\nWere at the best place around\n\nBut some stupid with a flare gun\n\nBurned the place to the ground\n\nSmoke on the water, fire in the sky, smoke on the water\n\nThey burned down the gambling house\n\nIt died with an awful sound\n\nFunky claude was running in and out\n\nPulling kids out the ground\n\nWhen it all was over\n\nWe had to find another place\n\nBut swiss time was running out\n\nIt seemed that we would lose the race\n\nSmoke on the water, fire in the sky, smoke on the water\n\nWe ended up at the grand hotel\n\nIt was empty cold and bare\n\nBut with the rolling truck stones thing just outside\n\nMaking our music there\n\nWith a few red lights and a few old beds\n\nWe make a place to sweat\n\nNo matter what we get out of this\n\nI know we'll never forget\n\nSmoke on the water, fire in the sky, smoke on the water"
